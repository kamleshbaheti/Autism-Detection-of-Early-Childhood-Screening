# Autism Detection for Early Childhood Screening

## Overview
This project aims to detect autism in early childhood screening using Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning models. Two models were developed as part of this project:

- **Autism_model.ipynb**: This notebook contains the model trained on a verified dataset obtained from a reliable source. It includes code to train the model, create confusion matrices, and generate graphs to visualize the results.

- **Autism_input_model.ipynb**: This notebook allows users to input data and apply machine learning techniques based on the training from the previous model. It is designed to take user input and produce output predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Instructions
To run the project:
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed or you can install jupyter extension in VS Code.
2. Clone or download the project repository.
3. Install all the required modules.
4. Open the respective IDE:
   - `Autism_model.ipynb`
   - `Autism_input_model.ipynb`
5. Follow the instructions within each notebook to execute the code and interact with the models.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the models is obtained from a verified source.
